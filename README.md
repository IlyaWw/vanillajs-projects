# VanillaJS projects

Made to understand my favourite PL better, following awesome [bootcamp course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/).

Each project is in a separate folder. Open corresponding index.js in a browser to view.

## Projects so far

1. Pomodoro timer app
2. Movie comparison app (using [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/))
